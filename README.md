## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an AI agent system called the **Interactive Learning Companion**, a Python programming tutor that adapts to individual learners.

The agent:
- Answers Python questions at different difficulty levels
- Generates explanations and examples
- Uses tools to execute Python code and perform web search (stub)
- Maintains a learner profile and adjusts difficulty over time
- Includes safety, input validation, and RL-style feedback and policy improvement
